1. Using the version C++11
2. Overall programming paradigm : C++ supports inheritance, polymorphism and encapsulation; therefore C++ is an object oriented programming language.
3. It is a compiled language, since it translates the language into the machine language.
4. It is a statically typed language. The type checking in C++ is done at compile time. In C++, variables, functions and parameters has specific type before compiling the code.
In C++, if the function is known at compile time, then it is static binding, whereas when a function is known at run time, then it is dynamic binding.
5. C++ is strongly type, since it required the user to specify the type of each variable and data structure.
6. C++ has manual memory management and does not have garbage collector. It manually uses instructions such as new/delete to allocate and deallocate the objects.
7. C++11 has closures. Closure is an inner function that has access to the outer functionâ€™s variables.
8.C++11 deals with concurrency. C++11 includes utilities for starting and managing threads and utilities for synchronization like mutexes.

PYTHON:

1. Using the version Python 3.7.
2. Overall programming paradigm : Python supports multiple programming paradigms, it is imperative, functional , object-oriented and procedural. 
3. It is interpreted language, since it is run and executed by an interpreter.
4. It is dynamically typed language. The type checking in python is done at run time.
5. Python is strongly typed, since it required the user to specify the type of each variable and function type.
6. Python has garbage collector. It removes every object not referenced to.
7. Python has first class functions. Every function in python is first class, because the functions can be passed around like any other object.
8. Python deals with concurrency. Threading is most common approach to attain concurrency in Python
